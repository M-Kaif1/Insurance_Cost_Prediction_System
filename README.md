# Insurance Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Predicting individual insurance charges using demographic and health-related features with a complete machine learning workflow, including data exploration, visualization, model training, evaluation, and interactive prediction.**

---

## Project Overview

Insurance charges depend on multiple factors such as age, BMI, number of children, sex, smoking status, and region.  
This project demonstrates a **full machine learning pipeline** with a focus on **data-driven insights, model evaluation, and interpretability**.  

The project is modular, research-oriented, and suitable for undergraduate internship portfolios like **MBZUAI UGRIP**.
